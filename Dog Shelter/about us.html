        We are a group of people with a common goal; to live in a way that we cause minimum harm, and live to do maximum good work. It's our understanding that physical pain is objectively bad. So for us, reducing pain, and nurturing changes that reduce pain is an objective good.
shelter is a stray animal rescue , a no till organic farm. It started out as a home that we built with space for injured stray animals to heal & be heard, for people who wanted to help, and for us to be able to organically farm, while reducing our harm. Instead of putting in a swimming pool, we built a cow shed. Instead of media room, we have a clinic. Instead of having master bedrooms, we made rooms for those who want to come here and experience a simple, sustainable and purposeful life.

We started constructing the place on “tentative dates” in a small village near Dharamsala, “place name” and were operational by “tentative dates” .

We started doing good because of our beliefs. Then we learnt it feels great too!

Philosophy
The philosophy behind this was to reduce our suffering footprint (the suffering we cause in the course of living), and making our survival purposeful by doing good work.

Vision
To reduce physical suffering of animals.
